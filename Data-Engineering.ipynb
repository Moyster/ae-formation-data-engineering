    "### Understanding SQL and Relational Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational databases organize data into tables, which you can visualize as spreadsheets with rows and columns. Each table represents a specific type of entity or concept – imagine tables for \"Customers,\" \"Products,\" or \"Orders.\" \n",
    "To query these databases, we are using **SQL**, which is the standard language for interacting with relational databases. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rows (or Records): Each row in a table represents a single instance of that entity. For example, in the diagram below, in the \"Order\" table, each row would represent one specific order. We often refer to these as records.\n",
    "Columns (Attributes): Each column in a table represents a characteristic or attribute of that entity. In the \"Order\" table, columns might include \"UnitPrice,\" \"Quantity,\" and \"Discount.\" Each column has a specific data type (e.g., text, number, date).\n",
    "The power of relational databases lies in their ability to represent relationships between different entities. These relationships are created using keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Primary Key: A unique identifier for each record within a table. For example, \"CustomerID\" in the \"Customers\" table would likely be a primary key, ensuring that each customer has a unique identifier.\n",
    "+ Foreign Key: A column in one table that refers to the primary key of another table. This establishes a link between the two tables. For example, an \"Orders\" table might have a \"CustomerID\" column that is a foreign key referencing the \"CustomerID\" (primary key) in the \"Customers\" table. This way, you know which customer placed each order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tables are linked together through these keys, allowing you to perform complex queries that combine data from multiple tables. They can be linked using different types of relationships, such as one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a database schema diagram that illustrates these concepts:\n"

To make things easy, we use SQLite, a lightweight database that is easy to set up and use, and offers a simple way to work with SQL databases without needing a separate server.\n",

    "Set the Stage: Begin by defining the context: \"As a database engineer using [Your Database System]...\" that will help the system understand the environment and constraints.\n",
    "This important for the query to have the proper syntax and to avoid errors.\n",

    "🫸 Schema as Context: Always provide the relevant database schema as text at the beginning of your prompt or discussion. Without it, the AI model cannot understand what data it is manipulating, and will NEVER give you \n",

    "### 2. Prompt Engineering:\n",
    "\n",
    "Clarity is Key: Articulate your needs precisely. Avoid ambiguity!\n",
    "Example Prompts:\n",
    "\"I want the products generating the most revenue between 2014 and 2018.\"\n",
    "\"I want the name and phone number of our lead customer with over $1 million in purchases.\"\n",
    "Critical Review:\n",
    "\n",
    "Always Validate the AI's Output!\n",
    "Watch Out For:\n",
