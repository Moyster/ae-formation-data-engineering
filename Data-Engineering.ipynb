    "### Understanding SQL and Relational Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational databases organize data into tables, which you can visualize as spreadsheets with rows and columns. Each table represents a specific type of entity or concept â€“ imagine tables for \"Customers,\" \"Products,\" or \"Orders.\" \n",
    "To query these databases, we are using **SQL**, which is the standard language for interacting with relational databases. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rows (or Records): Each row in a table represents a single instance of that entity. For example, in the diagram below, in the \"Order\" table, each row would represent one specific order. We often refer to these as records.\n",
    "Columns (Attributes): Each column in a table represents a characteristic or attribute of that entity. In the \"Order\" table, columns might include \"UnitPrice,\" \"Quantity,\" and \"Discount.\" Each column has a specific data type (e.g., text, number, date).\n",
    "The power of relational databases lies in their ability to represent relationships between different entities. These relationships are created using keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Primary Key: A unique identifier for each record within a table. For example, \"CustomerID\" in the \"Customers\" table would likely be a primary key, ensuring that each customer has a unique identifier.\n",
    "+ Foreign Key: A column in one table that refers to the primary key of another table. This establishes a link between the two tables. For example, an \"Orders\" table might have a \"CustomerID\" column that is a foreign key referencing the \"CustomerID\" (primary key) in the \"Customers\" table. This way, you know which customer placed each order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tables are linked together through these keys, allowing you to perform complex queries that combine data from multiple tables. They can be linked using different types of relationships, such as one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a database schema diagram that illustrates these concepts:\n"
