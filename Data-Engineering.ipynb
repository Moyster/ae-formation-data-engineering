    "\n",
    "- Rows (Records): Individual entries in your table\n",
    "One row = one specific instance\n",
    "For example: In a table sotring the \"Orders\" information, each row represents a single order. It is also called \"records\" in database terminology\n",

    "- Columns (or Attributes for the Excel lovers): Those are the characteristics you track\n",
    "Each column stores one type of information, for an order, \"UnitPrice,\" \"Quantity,\" \"Discount\" in the \"Orders\" table\n",

    "It is an unique identifier for each record in a table, like a passport number or an id card ‚Äì two records can't share the same primary key\n",

    "A column that points to the primary key in another table\n",

    "\n",
    "Not all AI tools are created equal when it comes to SQL:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Claude 4 sonnet / opus (Anthropic)** - Excellent at understanding complex business logic. From experience it handles large schemas well, which is super important on critical databases.\n",
    "More cautious with potentially destructive queries and Better at explaining its reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "**ChatGPT 4.1  (OpenAI)** ü•à- Good for standard queries\n",
    "- Sometimes overly confident with complex joins\n",
    "\n",
    "**Company / private LLMs** üè¢ Keep your data inside ! A schema can contain important / confidential informations, be careful where you paste them.\n",

    "### The Golden Rule: Schema First! üìã\n",
    "\n",
    "The #1 mistake people make? Asking for SQL without providing context. AI models aren't mind readers ‚Äì they need to know your database structure.\n",

    "```\n",

    "**2. Be Crystal Clear About Your Needs**\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of: \"I want customer data\"\n",
    "\n",

    "- Placed orders in the last 90 days\n",
    "- Have a total order value exceeding 10,000 CHF\n",
    "- Are based in Switzerland or Germany\n",
    "Include their company name, total spent, and last order date\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Specify the Output Format**\n",
    "Tell the AI exactly what columns you want and how they should be named:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"Return columns: CustomerName, TotalRevenue, LastOrderDate, Country\n",

    "\n",
    "**Always Review Before Running:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. üß® **Check for Destructive Commands**\n",
    "   - Never run queries with `DROP`, `DELETE`, `TRUNCATE` without double-checking\n",
    "   - Be wary of `UPDATE` statements without proper `WHERE` clauses\n",
    "\n",
    "2. üîç **Validate the Logic**\n",
    "   - Are the date ranges correct?\n",
    "   - Do the JOIN conditions make sense?\n",
    "   - Will this query return way too much data?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ü´∏ **Test on Development First**\n",
    "   - Run new queries on test data before production\n",
    "   - Add `LIMIT 10` to test the output structure\n",
    "\n",
    "4. üìâ **Watch for Performance Killers**\n",
    "   - Missing WHERE clauses on large tables\n",
    "   - Unnecessary nested subqueries\n",
    "   - DISTINCT on large result sets\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pro Tips for AI-Assisted SQL üöÄ\n",
    "\n",
    "**Iterative Refinement**\n",
    "Don't expect perfection on the first try. Start simple, then add complexity:\n",
    "1. Get the basic query working\n",
    "2. Add filters and conditions\n",
    "3. Optimize for performance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learn from the AI**\n",
    "When the AI generates a query, ask it to:\n",
    "- Explain each part of the query\n",
    "- Suggest performance improvements\n",
    "- Show alternative approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "**Build Your Prompt Library**\n",
    "Save successful prompts as templates, on a Sharepoint, Notes, wherever you can find and share them ! :\n",

    "### Common Pitfalls to Avoid with AI ü§ñ‚ö†Ô∏è\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The Schema Assumption**\n",
    "   AI might assume column names or relationships. Always verify against your actual schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The Timezone Trap**\n",
    "   Be explicit about timezones when dealing with dates: \"Using UTC timestamps...\".. This one is painful, make sure you double check !\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The NULL Surprise**\n",
    "   AI often forgets about NULL values. Explicitly mention how to handle them. Do not hesistate to feed your errors back into the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **The Performance Blind Spot**\n",
    "   AI doesn't know your table sizes. Mention if you're dealing with millions of rows, and fingers crossed, it will optimize the query.\n",

Instead, with a handful of core tools, we transformed ourselves from passive observers into active investigators.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ We learned to peek at data with select and limit, and to ask for specific columns instead of everything.\n",
    "+ We used where, and, and or to filter the noise and focus on the data that mattered, like finding premium products or customers in key markets.\n",
    "+ We created new information on the fly by doing calculations directly in our queries.\n",
    "+ Most importantly, we learned to connect the dots with join. This was the key that unlocked the true power of our relational database, allowing us to build a complete picture from separate tables. We saw how to answer complex business questions, from finding our top sales performers to mapping out the company's internal reporting structure.\n",

    "We left our bonus-season query at a crucial point. We have a long list of every sale transaction next to the employee who made it, but it's not the final answer. The immediate next step in your SQL journey is to learn about aggregation. These are functions that summarise or group your data. You would use:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ group by to tell the database to bundle rows together (e.g., group all sales by employee).\n",
    "+ sum() to add up values (e.g., sum(LineTotal) to get the total sales value for that group).\n",
    "+ count() to count the number of rows (e.g., how many orders a customer has placed).\n",
    "+ avg(), min(), and max() to find the average, minimum, and maximum values in a group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these aggregation functions will allow you to turn that long list of sales into a concise leaderboard, finally answering the \"who gets the bonus\" question. Beyond aggregation, you can explore more advanced SQL concepts like window functions (for complex rankings and comparisons) and common table expressions or CTEs (for making long queries more readable).\n",

Tools like Snowflake, Amazon Redshift, or Google BigQuery are designed to handle enormous amounts of data‚Äîterabytes or even petabytes. The good news is that they all speak SQL. The syntax you've learned is 95% transferable. These systems are powerful because they separate the cost of storing data from the cost of querying it, allowing companies to store everything and analyse it on demand.\n",

    "+ Inconsistent data: You might find the same country listed as 'USA', 'US', and 'United States' in the same column.\n",
    "+ Incorrect data types: Numbers stored as text, dates in strange formats.\n",
    "+ Duplicate records: The same order or customer entered twice.\n",
    "A huge part of a data engineer's job is not just querying data, but cleaning and transforming it so that it becomes reliable and useful. This process is often called ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)."
